# Quantitative Economics for Business [MBE-L]

\tableofcontents <!-- you can use \toc as well -->

## Description

The aim of Quantitative Economics for Business is to provide an introduction to the practice of econometrics.

We will cover both theoretical and practical aspects, but the emphasis will be on intuitive understanding. Real-world business applications will introduce the econometric techniques and concepts object of the course. Learning by doing is essential to master econometrics: students will do a fair amount of hands-on work.

The methods taught in this introductory course are useful in business (accounting, finance, marketing, management) and many social science disciplines (economics and political science).

At the end of the course, students of Quantitative Economics for Business know basic statistics and probability relatively well. They can comfortably use R, the statistical/econometric computer software, and report their work results in a non-technical and literate manner. They can estimate and interpret linear regression models and can distinguish between economic importance and statistical significance. They should be able to critique regression results in applied academic papers and interpret the results for someone who is not a trained econometrician.

### Covid-19

Due to the Covid-19 emergency, this course will be taught remotely. Lectures will be streamed live on Zoom. Recordings of the lectures (and all the supporting material) will be made available on the Teams channel (link).

Links to each lecture will be posted on the Teams channel. Students will need to register in advance for the lecture using their institutional email (`@unipi.it`). The registration is necessary to ensure the highest level of security.

### Textbook

The textbook for this course is Stock and Watson's Introduction to Econometrics:

- Stock, James H. and Mark W. Watson, _Introduction to Econometrics_, Addison Wesley; 3rd edition, ISBN: 1408264331

Stock and Watson's Introduction to Econometrics is nicely organized and easy to read. However, no book is a perfect fit for everyone. Many other books can serve as the primary reference to the material. A good example is Jeffrey Wooldridge's Introduction to Econometrics

- Jeffrey Wooldridge, _Introductory Econometrics_, South Western, fourth edition, 4th edition, ISBN: 0324788908

### Assessment

The final grade of this class is calculated as follow:

1. Homework assignments (35%)
2. Midterm (35%)
3. Final exam (30%)

_Note_:

- Students who do not turn in the homework assignments or do not take the midterm can take a (much) longer final exam worth 100% of the grade (this option is also available to students who prefer to forfeit their grade on *both* midterm and homework assignments)

Homework assignments and midterm's grades will be considered only for the first three exam dates ("appelli") following the course's end. Starting from the fourth "appello", the exam will consist solely of a longer comprehensive final exam.

- No student will be allowed to take the exam on two subsequent exam dates (no exceptions). ("Taking the exam" here means sitting and looking at the exam). All the exams, at least up to December 2020, are remote.

### Tutorial Sessions

There will be weekly tutorial sessions. These sessions are useful for reviewing the material introduced during regular lecture and helping students familiarize with R.
