## Description

Quantitative Economics for Business aims to introduce the practice of econometrics.

We will cover theoretical and practical aspects, but the emphasis will be on intuitive understanding. Real-world business applications will introduce econometric techniques and concepts. Learning by doing is essential to master econometrics: students will do a fair amount of hands-on work.

The methods taught in this introductory course are helpful in business (accounting, finance, marketing, management) and many social science disciplines (economics, sociology, and political science).

At the end of the course, students of Quantitative Economics for Business should know basic statistics and probability relatively well. They should be comfortable using R and should be able to report the finding of their analysis in a non-technical and literate manner. In addition, they should know how to estimate and interpret linear and nonlinear models. 

## Topics

1. Introduction to R
2. Review of probability and statistics 
3. Univariate and multivare regression
4. Endogeneity and causality
5. Nonlinear regression models
6. Panel Data
7. Instrumental Variables
8. Introduction to Machine Learning

## Textbook

The textbook for this course is Stock and Watson's Introduction to Econometrics:

- Stock, James H. and Mark W. Watson, _Introduction to Econometrics_, Addison Wesley; 3rd edition, ISBN: 1408264331

Stock and Watson's Introduction to Econometrics is nicely organized and easy to read. However, a more exhaustive treatment of the topics covered in this course is:

- Jeffrey Wooldridge, _Introductory Econometrics_, South Western, fourth edition, 4th edition, ISBN: 0324788908

## R

`R` is both a programming language and software environment for statistical computing, which is *free* and *open-source*. To get started, you will need to install two pieces of software:

1. [`R`, the actual programming language.](https://www.r-project.org)
    - Chose your operating system, and select the most recent version.
1. [RStudio, an excellent IDE for working with `R`.](http://www.rstudio.com/)
    - Note, you must have `R` installed to use RStudio. RStudio is simply an interface used to interact with `R`.

Here is a list of online resources that might be useful to master R:

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz)
- [ModernDive](https://moderndive.com/)
- [Awesome R Learning Resources](https://github.com/iamericfletcher/awesome-r-learning-resources)


## Lectures 

| Day       | Time  | Classroom |

Lectures will be streamed live on Teams. A link to the stream will be made available on the [Teams Channel][] a few hours before the start of each class. Lectures will not be recorded, and in-person should be considered the standard way of attendance. 

## Communication

## Assessment

The final grade is based on:

1. Homework assignments (35%)
2. Midterm (35%)
3. Final exam (30%)

\warn{
Date of the midterm: **April 5, 2022**
}

Students who do not turn in the homework assignments or do not take the midterm can take a **(much) longer final exam worth 100% of the grade**. This option is also available to students who prefer to forfeit their grades on *both* midterm and homework assignments.

\warn{
Homework assignments and the midterm exam go together. If a student fails to score at least 18/30 on the midterm, she will automatically **forfeit** her grades on the homework assignments. The same holds if she fails to turn in even one assignment or does not score 18/30 in one of them. 
}

I strongly urge students to take the midterm **and** turn in all the homework assignments -- this option makes passing the course with a satisfactory grade more manageable. 


\warn{
    After the course's end, homework assignments and midterm grades will be considered only for **the first three exam dates ("appelli")**. Then, starting from the fourth "appello", the exam will consist solely of the longer comprehensive final exam.
}

\warn{
No student will be allowed to take the exam on two subsequent dates -- **no exceptions**. ("Taking the exam" means sitting and looking at the exam). 
}
